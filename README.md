# topanga
A Python library to create a grouping of docker containers initially inspired heavily by docker-compose. The main thrust of this project is to provide a consistent API to manage the container group without being bound to the command line or a yml file. The library should be able to parse a yml file and the config should be JSON friendly. It will be used by the Amhappy project.
